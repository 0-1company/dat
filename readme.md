## Getting started

**The Dat Alpha release is out now**. [Read the announcement post here](docs/dat-stable-alpha.md).

We have prepared an in-browser workshop for learning dat. You can try it out here: [http://maxogden.github.io/get-dat](http://maxogden.github.io/get-dat)

We also recommend reading the [getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md).

## Deploy to heroku

The easiest way to try dat is using our [heroku-dat-template](https://github.com/bmpvieira/heroku-dat-template#heroku-dat-template) which lets you deploy a dat directly to heroku all from your browser, no command-line required.

## Install

You need to install node.js version 0.10 or above. We recommend that you install node from the [node website](http://nodejs.org/).

You can check your node version by running `node -v` on the command line.

To get the currently published version (recommended):

```
npm install dat -g
```

The `-g` means "install globally" which makes the `dat` command available in your command line path.

You can also install the latest development version with `git` (experienced users only):

```
git clone git://github.com/maxogden/dat.git
cd dat
npm install
npm link
```
