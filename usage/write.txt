Write binary data into dat. This differs from `import` in that it doesn't parse the file, it just stores it as a binary attachment. `import` is designed for key/value row-like, or tabular data. `write` is meant for large files, blobs, or attachments that you can't parse into rows.

Write a file to dat:

 dat write <path-to-file>
  -d <dataset-name> # the name of the dataset to create. required
  -n <filename> # the name of the file. if not supplied, uses the path

Stream data from stdin:

  python generate_model_data.py | dat write model_data -
